        <title>The Golden Ticket</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you start a project and eventually have a difficult time of gathering time to put some work into it.
This was starting to be the case for my project wagon. I bought it to turn it something of my own and did tiny bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-hassle&quot;&gt;The hassle&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, those small efforts seem to take too much time to pull off. All the longer sessions were mostly filled with scheduling about how I’m about to pull something apart and be sure it’s all assembled when I need to drive the thing because &lt;strong&gt;it’s my daily car!&lt;/strong&gt; One of those things were stuff like fixing my PCV system with barely any experience with PCV systems and Volvo cars in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-savior&quot;&gt;My savior&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a while ago I left my job (for reasons!), found a new one (not as easy as writing this sentence) and got my first company car after a month and a half of work! Blessed with a &lt;strong&gt;third daily&lt;/strong&gt;, I’m finally able to endeavour into my adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-lineup&quot;&gt;New lineup&lt;/h1&gt;

        <title>Trying out Techno Textile Cleaner</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/e8QMBzTEAyQ&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-channel-new-challanges&quot;&gt;New channel, new challanges!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I fell in love with this brick of a car. Namely a Volvo 850 estate!
This car has a 2.5l engine and is equipped with a dual fuel system. Since prices on gas are very high out here, I can always easy the pain on my wallet by filling her up with LPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sturdy, intimidating and still fast as fuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video above is actually more of an excuse to create a video. I need to scrub off the editor rust, since I did enjoy some long editing sessions back when I had a Windows ME that could barely run anything decent to the DELL laptop that recently died with Windows Vista running on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not going too in depth in this. Just to get you the idea of what kind of tier my gear was in back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Already by making my first video I’m testing different render settings, presentation techniques and figuring out how to introduce and end my videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, this video won’t have a decent outro just because I have no clips to show about previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-product-tested&quot;&gt;The product, tested&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up, it didn’t do any good of a job. You could see on a white cloth that it rubbed of some grimy stuff. I bet you could get the same result by rubbing the cloth without this product. It didn’t cost anything really. 2 euros at max I think in a local cheap ass store. Not to lay a burn on this store. They actually DO have stuff that is very useful for a good price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feedback&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the very start of a new beginning so don’t hold back on me in the comment section below. But I advice you to keep your commentary somewhat constructive so I can actually benefit from the info.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First vlog ever</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/jXp4QsfvqoE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-karma&quot;&gt;Bad karma?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rather dubious about the idea of maintaining a blog and vlog at the same time but I finally got to the point to kick this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recording this video, not everything went according to plan though. The plan was to record my day in my Volvo, while doing some mods and touch ups at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, my wallet thought it was a good idea to stay put on my roof while leaving a store parking lot. Long story short, I lost it and somebody was kind enough to bring it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, thanks for not emptying out my wallet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the event of me actually getting contacted that my wallet was found, I went totally nuts. In my head I actually went to hell and back, thinking about the &lt;strong&gt;lost cash, my ID, driving license and the freaking CARD-STOP process&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-recording-process&quot;&gt;The recording process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never did I even record myself for something serious on YouTube and you’ll probably notice that while watching this one. Even when I’m aware of that, it’s still very accomplishing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You wont see vlogs every day because there are other videos aside from the vlogs I will need to edit.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, when writing this I’m still working on the basic structure of this website, other hobbies, work, friends to keep in touch with. You don’t actually work 24/7 on YouTube content and I really don’t get it yet how the regulars do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editing&quot;&gt;Editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day I really liked to edit videos in Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere. Now that I’ve installed Premiere again I can’t bear to notice how much things has changed. So the first task was picking up the ropes again of the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there are a lot more kinds of software in the Adobe suite used for video media. Recently tried out Prelude, a piece of software that encourages you to create a rough cut before diving into the more complicated Premiere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll talk about my workflow later on but until then I’ll keep learning more about it. Also to prevent misinforming you peeps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for supporting me by reading this article and don’t hesitate to leave some feedback (positive or negative I don’t care) to help me improve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
