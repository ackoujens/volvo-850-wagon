        <title>First vlog ever!</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/jXp4QsfvqoE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bad-karma&quot;&gt;Bad karma?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rather dubious about the idea of maintaining a blog and vlog at the same time but I finally got to the point to kick this off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While recording this video, not everything went according to plan though. The plan was to record my day in my Volvo, while doing some mods and touch ups at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, my wallet thought it was a good idea to stay put on my roof while leaving a store parking lot. Long story short, I lost it and somebody was kind enough to bring it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, thanks for not emptying out my wallet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the event of me actually getting contacted that my wallet was found, I went totally nuts. In my head I actually went to hell and back, thinking about the &lt;strong&gt;lost cash, my ID, driving license and the freaking CARD-STOP process&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-recording-process&quot;&gt;The recording process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never did I even record myself for something serious on YouTube and you’ll probably notice that while watching this one. Even when I’m aware of that, it’s still very accomplishing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You wont see vlogs every day because there are other videos asside from the vlogs I will need to edit.&lt;/strong&gt; Also, when writing this I’m still working on the basic structure of this website, other hobbies, work, friends to keep in touch with. You don’t actually work 24/7 on YouTube content and I really don’t get it yet how the regulars do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;editing&quot;&gt;Editing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the day I really liked to edit videos in Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere. Now that installed Premiere again I can’t bear to notice how much things has changed. So the first task was picking up the ropes again of the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there are allot more kinds of software in the Adobe suite used for video media. Recently tried out Prelude, a piece of software that encourages you to create a rough cut before diving into the more complicated Premiere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ll talk about my workflow later on but until then I’ll keep learning more about it. Also to prevent misinforming you peeps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for supporting me by reading this article and don’t hesitate to leave some feedback (positive or negative I don’t care) to help me improve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
