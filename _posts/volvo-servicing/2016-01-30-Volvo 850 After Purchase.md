Volvo 850 full maintenance
After a while of considering, I finally decided to buy my very own Volvo 850 wagon! Of course, this is an old car and it will need some love and support allong the years to come. So I scavenged the internet for information and landed on the Robert DIY channel. In my opinion, this is the best resource I’ve found for this specific car and I hope I’ll see more of his fixes so I’ll be able to handle this like a pro!
Based on his New Volvo owned things to do after purchase video, I compiled this list for my own and others benefit. Print it out, keep it on your laptop or tablet, because this is going to come in handy for everyone tackling this car.
Timing belt
The timing belt is located on the front of the motor under a plastic case. (marked in the image below)

Has it been replaced recently and is it serviceable?
Look for a sticker that marks when the timing belt has been replaced. These can be found on different places under the hood (marked in the images below) or you can check the service records if your car has one. You want to have written proof of this, as it is nearly impossible to check this just by looking at the belt itself.

The timing belt needs to be replaced within the allowed time that is written in the owners manual. In cars that are from 1998 and prior that would be around 7 years or 110000km’s.
My timing belt has been replaced at around 260000km’s (march 2016). My best bet would be replacing the belt at 360000km’s or when I still haven’t wrecked it in 2023!
Like many new vehicles, this car has an interference motor. So if this car jumped time or the timing belt breaks then you’ll need to rebuild the engine. I consider this a totalled cause as this would be a very expensive operation.
Water pump
When you remove the cover of the timing belt and look down in between the different cogs, you’ll find the water pump. (marked in the image below)

If the cog of the water pump is missing some of it’s teeth, it should be replaced and probably is still the original one. Judging by the video I just saw, I also believe that this pump should be replaced every 10 years as this piece is going to be under allot of stress whenever your engine is running. 
I’ve not checked this already but I’ll definitely update this paragraph when I have. I guess that it actually wasn’t replaced as people tend to not replace it when the part isn’t completely failing. I could be wrong though ...
On newer water pumps, you ofter can see the year and month it was made. This can be very handy when deciding when to pull or leave a water pump in. Also, the OEM water pumps ofter have the brand Volvo or Aisin stamped on it together with the reference id.

Aside from the water pump, you also have cogs of the tensioner pulley and the idler pulley to keep an eye on. (first image: tensioner pulley, second image: idler pulley)

Heater core system
This is probably the N°1 cause of all cars of this type that end up in the junkyard. A failing heater core system means an overheating engine.
If you look in the back of the engine bay, you can see the heater lines that go into the cabin. These end up in the heater core, which is under the dash and really easy to access.

The problem with these things are that it leaks down under the carpet, where you may not know it. It’s best that you have written proof of this but you can also check it for cracks / aged plastic (which is mostly brown).
I’m 99% sure this hasn’t been replaced as this part would be very durable and can last around 10 years. I probably should look for a new replacement kit and hope I can get the whole plastic cover also.
To find the heater core, pull away the carpet and plastic panel near the console. (like in the pictures below)

Replacing the heater core is very easy to do and very recommended to do so. You can get this part for around 45 EUR shipped and it should take you around 30-60 minutes to replace these.
Positive Crankcase Ventilation system
This system takes care of emissions and circulates gasses in the motor. When clogged it can cause pressure to build up in the motor, major oil leaks and a rear main seal leak can be an end result.
What you want to do is check the hose near the oil cap. (marked on the image below) Check if the hose is either soft or rock solid. If the hose is hard, chances are that it hasn’t been replaced or serviced in a while.

Secondly, if you have the car running on a normal operating temperature you want to pull the oil dipstick. If a puff of smoke comes out there, this can be a sign of an unserviced PCV system.
Another way to check the PCV is to pull a glove over the oil filler and leave the engine running. If the PCV system is any good, it will try to suck the glove in and even better when you rev the engine. (first image below)
A bad sign of the condition of the PCV is that it will try to inflate the glove and will confirm if you are in the need of a new kit. (second image below)

Coolant system
Check your coolant system for old coolant hoses. You sure don’t want to play coolant roulette with these cars. A leak in one of these hoses can turn into a burst hose. When this happens, it can quickly turn into an overheating engine as well.
See if your hoses are still soft and pliable. If you have a turbocharged car, find out how many hoses you have and get them replaced. If your car isn’t turbo then you probably have less hoses.
Check your level on your coolant bottle for cracks or any other damage. Also be sure that the coolant bottle cap is still good and won’t cause any leaks.

Secondly, see that your coolant level doesn’t drop. If so, you probably have a leak somewhere and this needs to get checked on.
Oil change
If you don’t have documented proof of the last oil change, change your oil and replace your oil filter. Primary reason to do this is to make sure you have a MANN filter installed on your Volvo. This filter makes sure you have oil on top of your engine when it’s turned off so it won’t starve the motor for oil when you try to start the engine.

Also check on your valve stem seals, go for your lifters. Be sure also to put in the right type of oil. (which also depends on what type of climate you drive your car in)
Transmission
Make sure fluid is high, oil is not brown. Check your manual how to drain and fill so your transmission will roll smoothly.
Tune up
Install new Volvo sparkplugs and prevent ignition problems with these cars. Secondly take a look at your wires, if you look at the spark plug wires, you will see the nth week of the nth year printed on them.
Recommended spark plug wires are bougicords or the OEM Volvo ones. Volvo tends to be very finicky when it comes down on these so I wont risk using any other ones.

The plugs should be replaced every 30000 miles. Wire cap & rotor, every 100000 miles or either 10 years.
Other thing you can do is replace the battery if necessary. Other fluid levels of brake fluid, power steering and others should be also checked for quality and replaced or flushed. You can also check other general hoses and motor mounts.
