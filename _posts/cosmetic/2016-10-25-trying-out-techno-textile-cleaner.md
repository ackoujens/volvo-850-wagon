## New channel, new challanges!

A while ago I fell in love with this brick of a car. Namely a Volvo 850 estate!
This car has a 2.5l engine and is equipped with a dual fuel system. Since prices on gas are very high out here, I can always easy the pain on my wallet by filling her up with LPG.

> Sturdy, intimidating and still fast as fuck.

The video above is actually more of an excuse to create a video. I need to scrub off the editor rust, since I did enjoy some long editing sessions back when I had a Windows ME that could barely run anything decent to the DELL laptop that recently died with Windows Vista running on top.

Not going too in depth in this. Just to get you the idea of what kind of tier my gear was in back then.

Already by making my first video I'm testing different render settings, presentation techniques and figuring out how to introduce and end my videos.

Alright, this video won't have a decent outro just because I have no clips to show about previous ones.

## The product, tested

To sum it up, it didn't do any good of a job. You could see on a white cloth that it rubbed of some grimy stuff. I bet you could get the same result by rubbing the cloth without this product. It didn't cost anything really. 2 euros at max I think in a local cheap ass store. Not to lay a burn on this store. They actually DO have stuff that is very useful for a good price.
