## Bad karma?

I was rather dubious about the idea of maintaining a blog and vlog at the same time but I finally got to the point to kick this off.

While recording this video, not everything went according to plan though. The plan was to record my day in my Volvo, while doing some mods and touch ups at first.

Along the way, my wallet thought it was a good idea to stay put on my roof while leaving a store parking lot. Long story short, I lost it and somebody was kind enough to bring it in.

Before the event of me actually getting contacted that my wallet was found, I went totally nuts. In my head I actually went to hell and back, thinking about the **lost cash, my ID, driving license and the freaking CARD-STOP process**.

## The recording process

Never did I even record myself for something serious on YouTube and you'll probably notice that while watching this one. Even when I'm aware of that, it's still very accomplishing to do!

**You wont see vlogs every day because there are other videos aside from the vlogs I will need to edit.** Also, when writing this I'm still working on the basic structure of this website, other hobbies, work, friends to keep in touch with. You don't actually work 24/7 on YouTube content and I really don't get it yet how the regulars do this.

## Editing

Back in the day I really liked to edit videos in Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere. Now that I've installed Premiere again I can't bear to notice how much things has changed. So the first task was picking up the ropes again of the editing process.

Secondly, there are a lot more kinds of software in the Adobe suite used for video media. Recently tried out Prelude, a piece of software that encourages you to create a rough cut before diving into the more complicated Premiere.

Maybe I'll talk about my workflow later on but until then I'll keep learning more about it. Also to prevent misinforming you peeps!

**Thanks for supporting me by reading this article and don't hesitate to leave some feedback (positive or negative I don't care) to help me improve.**
