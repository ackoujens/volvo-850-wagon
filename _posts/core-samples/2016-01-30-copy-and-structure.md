Github pages provides me a centralised, lightweight and maintainable solution for making a portfolio presentation in the interrest of potential recruiters, buyers or enthusiast alike.
Structure
	•	index.html Description: introduction and story Target: recruitment and further interrest in content
	•	skills.html = software development / web development / design Description: display of expertise, previous jobs/projects, interests Target: bring skills into detail to complete recruitment target
	•	projects.html > category filters Description: featured projects and link to project page Target: good impression to recruiters, purchase of product and user feedback
	•	blog.html > category filters Description: chronological presentation of general blog articles, frequently related to projects / experiments and other repositories Target: intellectual impression to recruiters, informational, form of reference
	•	contact.html Description: contact me by using a webform or provide link for e-mail client / provide links to several social media platforms which only contain formal and professional information
