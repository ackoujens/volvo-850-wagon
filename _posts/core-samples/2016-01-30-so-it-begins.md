I’ve been working on this website for a while now and I’ve never been so satisfied with the end result. (said no developer ever)
Don’t worry I’m not another “Welcome to my blog”-guy. I’m not here to introduce you to anything. Why? Because this blog and the entirety around it is really nothing more or less than a personal log. (which all of you can enjoy too, because the stupid f*ck posted it online!)
