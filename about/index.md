## Volvo Valour Vlogs
To top this off, I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRtdHn14S8pudL77Mb-hznQ) to enlarge my social media experience and knowledge. 
All the stuff in the paragraph above will go hand in hand with a fitting video.
The blog posts also can turn into a vlog if I have the time to work them out.
I won't be posting multiple times a week since I still have to work during weekdays but this is only a start and things are still phrone to change.
This all ofcourse when I'm noticing an increase of interrest.

## Getting Started

Now the only thing I can hope for is that this baby will take off and grow into something usefull to me and other car maniacs!
